        <p>As part of our commitment to protecting client privacy, Design Creatic only collects information that is
            absolutely necessary to fulfil your request. Unless you give us permission to do so, we never disclose any
            of your information to anybody outside of our organisation.</p>
        <h3>Information Gathering</h3>
        <p>We obtain client information through the Order Form, Phone, Contact Us, and Email channels, and it is
            safeguarded in accordance with Design Creatic's privacy policy. Information about customers is never sold,
            shared, or exposed to unaffiliated third parties.</p>
        <p>We obtain client information through the Order Form, Phone, Contact Us, and Email channels, and it is
            safeguarded in accordance with Design Creatic's privacy policy. Information about customers is never sold,
            shared, or exposed to unaffiliated third parties.</p>
        <p>The information collection process also involves opinions regarding the product, such as criticisms,
            compliments, and comments.</p>
        <p>Your IP address, the version of your browser, the name of your operating system, and the time and date of
            your visit are among the technical details that are gathered and stored. These statistics are also gathered
            using Google Analytics or a service or product that is comparable.</p>
        <h3>Use of the Data Collected</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, the data we gather enables us to determine precisely what product you require and any
            specific features you might need in it. In addition, billing data is necessary for the payment process.</p>
        <p>Email addresses are used to communicate with customers regarding order status, suggestions, and the delivery
            of the finished product.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we reserve the right to email users about website updates, special offers, the introduction of
            new goods and services, and breaking business news.</p>
        <p>Additionally, this data aids in the development of our marketing plans and the creation of a list of the
            best-selling goods.</p>
        <h3>The secrecy of payments</h3>
        <p>We accept a variety of payment methods in order to ensure the best possible payment privacy. Secure Sockets
            Layer (SSL), which is denoted in the domain by the prefix "https://," is used by the payment processor when
            customers enter their billing information. As a result, we can guarantee that the confidentiality of the
            payment process and billing information is completely unaffected.</p>
        <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>Since we are completely aware of how important confidentiality is, we never compromise on protecting the
            privacy of our clients' information.</p>
        <p>In order to stay in touch with you and provide effective communication with the order process, we utilise
            your personal information for this purpose. Your entire information is therefore treated as confidential and
            saved in a secure location that is only accessible by the designated members, ensuring that it stays safe
            and there is no risk of it being stolen or hacked. This includes your name, billing address, email address,
            phone number, and fax number. We promise you that we will never disclose your personal information to a
            third party unless you authorise it or we are required to do so by law.</p>
        <h3>Amendments</h3>
        <p>If necessary, Design Creatic may modify its privacy policy to address stricter security concerns. However,
            all updates to privacy policies that affect the protection of personal information will be announced in
            advance of the day they become effective.</p>
        <h3>Conditions for Disclosure of Information</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, keeping your information private is our top focus. However, if we are to follow with the
            national law for judicial proceedings, court orders, or any other legal procedure, the information
            disclosure can only take place.</p>
        <h3>Message Us</h3>
        <p>You can use our contact form to get in touch with us if you're unclear about anything or have issues about
            our privacy policies.</p>
